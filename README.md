# FuseBox
http://fuse-box.org/
FuseBox is a bundler/module loader that combines the power of webpack, JSPM and SystemJS. 

It is blazing fast (it takes 50-100ms to re-bundle) which makes it extremely convenient for developers. It requires zero configuration to bundle such monsters like `babel-core`.

FuseBox loves __typescript__, and does not require any additional configuration. It will compile and bundle your code within a fraction of a second, yet offering a comprehensive loader API. It is packed with features, and unfolds limitless possibilities of extending the API.
