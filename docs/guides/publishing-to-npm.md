Here you will learn the best ways to make an npm package. There are 2 ways of
publishing a package that FuseBox will deal with.

[npm package seed](https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box-npm-package-seed))

## Publish raw typescript package (recommended)

It's highly encouraged not to make a bundle of your library for multiple
reasons.

- You will kill all the chances to tree shake it (whether it's FuseBox or
  WebPack)
- Typings may go wrong
- You need to make an extra effort to generate those ;-)

What is proposed instead - is pointing `ts:main` (which FuseBox will understand)
in package.json to a typescript source entry point.

This is how your `package.json` should look like in a perfectly composed npm
library:

```json
{
  "main": "dist/es5-bundle.js",
  "ts:main": "src/index.ts",
  "typings": "src/index.ts"
}
```

If you are not interested (nor your users) in using it outside of FuseBox, or
any bundles that supports bundling typescript code, you could do something like
this:

```json
{
  "main": "src/index.ts",
  "typings": "src/index.ts"
}
```

## What is the actual benefit of having typescript source exposed?

- FuseBox will be able to convert it to any script level (es6/es5/esnext) you
  desire. You can read up more on this [here](/page/configuration#target)
- Tree Shaking will be done just right
- You can do code splitting of external packages using `import()` statement

For example in this
[repository](https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-ts-raw-package)

```ts
// zxcvbn will be split lazy loaded in the final FuseBox build
export async function checkPassword(pwd: string, opts?: any) {
  const zxcvbn = import("zxcvbn");
  return zxcvbn(pwd, opts);
}
```

Once this library is bundled, FuseBox will automatically split `zxcvbn` library
(which is heavy) to a separate bundle without you even knowing it (you will
certainly notice it). Worth a mention - the actual splitting will happen when
making a produdction build, using [Quantum](/page/quantum)

## Publish a contained bundle

As said earlier, you would want to make a bundle anyway, whether it's a nodejs
library (without using FuseBox) or simply other cases that involve other
bundlers.

You can follow the seed
[here](https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box-npm-package-seed) to create an
isolated bundle.

It all comes down to two options - [containedAPI](/page/quantum#containedapi)
and [bakeApiIntoBundle](/page/quantum#bakeapiintobundle) It's important to
understand what these options actually do, so go ahead and read up on those.
