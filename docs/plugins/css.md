## Description

CSSPlugin is used to handle .css syntax. As such, it should always be at the end
of any CSS processing chain (see [#list-of-plugins](Plugin configuration) for
examples of plugin chains), as it handles everything that is relating to
bundling, reloading and grouping css styles.

## Usage

### Setup

Import from FuseBox

```js
const { CSSPlugin } = require("fuse-box");
```

Inject into a chain

```js
fuse.plugin(CSSPlugin());
```

Or add it to the main config plugins list to make it available across bundles

```js
FuseBox.init({
  plugins: [CSSPlugin()],
});
```

### Require file in your code

`import './main.css'`

With the example above and default configuration, `FuseBox` will converts
`main.css` file into a format that allows including it directly into javascript.

## Options

### outFile

The outFile option is used to bundle the `CSS` and write them to a file in your
bundle folder. `outFile` accepts a string or a function as parameter, if string
is used the file that will be written to disk will have the name defined in the
string, on the other hand, If a function is passed you would have more
flexibility by defining placeholders that will formulate the path of the file to
be written. for example :

```js
let tmp = "./tmp";
plugins: [
  CSSPlugin({
    outFile: file => `${tmp}/${file}`,
  }),
];
```

The above will write the `CSS` file into your bundle folder as follows
`myProject/dist/tmp/myBundle.css`

### inject

By default it is `true`. `FuseBox` will automatically inject your files into the
HEAD using link tags when imported. For example:

```js
import "directory/main.css";
```

will add the below to your Page.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css">
```

If you want to keep the magic but configure the injection yourself, you can
provide a callback to the inject parameter to customise your css file resolver
in the browser. For example:

```js
plugins: [
  CSSPlugin({
    outFile: file => `${tmp}/${file}`,
    inject: file => `custom/${file}`,
  }),
];
```

The above will result in:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="custom/main.css">
```

### group

You can group many css files into a single file. Imports of any individual file
will be converted into imports of the grouped file. For Example:

```js
plugins: [CSSPlugin({ group: "bundle.css" })];
```

The `group` option should not contain any relative or absolute paths. This is a
virtual file in the dependency tree. You can use all parameters described above
to customise the behaviour. For example:

```js
plugins: [
  CSSPlugin({
    group: "bundle.css",
  }),
];
```

```js
plugins: [
  CSSPlugin({
    group: "app.css",
    outFile: `${tmp}/app.css`,
  }),
];
```

> NOTE! outFile must be a string (not a callback) when used with the `group`
> option.
