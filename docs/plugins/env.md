## Description

Creates environment variables that can be accessed at build or run time. it
works both on server and in browser, You can even access in other `FuseBox`
plugins.

## Usage

### Setup

Import from FuseBox

```js
const { EnvPlugin } = require("fuse-box");
```

Inject into a chain

```js
fuse.plugin(EnvPlugin());
```

Or add it to the main config plugins list to make it available across bundles

```js
FuseBox.init({
  plugins: [EnvPlugin()],
});
```

### Require file in your code

Say you want to pass `Node_env` as global variable to your application, you can
do :

```js
plugins: [fsbx.EnvPlugin({ NODE_ENV: "production" })];
```

Then in your code you can access it in your code like
`process.env.${process.env.NODE_ENV}` which translates to the same as
`console.log(process.env.NODE_ENV)`.

## Options

`EnvPlugin` accepts a `key/value` object as a parameter. For example
`{myVarName: "production"}`

## Notes

The order of plugins is important: environment variables created with this
plugin will only be available to plugins further down the chain, so EnvPlugin
should be early in the list of plugins.

```js
plugins: [
  fsbx.BabelPlugin({
    /* settings */
  }), // <-- won't have NODE_ENV set
  fsbx.EnvPlugin({ NODE_ENV: "production" }),
  fsbx.BabelPlugin({
    /* settings */
  }), // <-- will have NODE_ENV set
];
```

## Test

To run tests

```
node test --file=EnvPlugin.test.ts
```
