## Usage

This plugin is included by default.  It is used to catch imports of json files
and transform them into a json object.

You can manually override the way the JSON is exported like so:

```ts
import { fusebox, pluginJSON } from 'fuse-box';
fusebox({
  plugins: [pluginJSON('configs/.*', { useDefault: true })],
});
```
