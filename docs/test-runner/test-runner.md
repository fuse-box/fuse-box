FuseBox provides a very convenient and a blazy fast test runner based on
TypeScript.

## Installation

Install it first

```bash
npm install fuse-test-runner
```

The concept is simple:

```js
fuse.bundle("app").test("[**/**.test.ts]");
```

Just replace `bundle.instructions()` with `bundle.test()`.

The entire FuseBox is powered by FuseBox tests. Check them out
[here](https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box/tree/master/src/tests):

github_example: test-runner

## Default pattern

FuseBox will take this pattern `[**/**.test.ts]` which can be overridden.

## Exposing tests

The following rules are required:

1.  Filename must end with `test.ts`
2.  Classes must be exported

Otherwise the file or class will be silently ignored.

## Example

```js
import { should } from "fuse-test-runner";
import { Bar } from "../Bar";

export class BarTest {
  "Should be okay"() {
    should(Bar)
      .beOkay()
      .beObject();
  }

  "Should construct Bar Object"() {
    should(new Bar())
      .beObject()
      .mutate((bar: Bar) => bar.name)
      .equal("I am bar");
  }
}
```

Note:

- You can use any assertion library (`chai`, `should`, `jsverify`, etc.) to
  chain and validate your objects.
- Methods can be written as strings to improve the readability.
- Test runner respects return promises as well as done callbacks
- All tests are executed in order they were defined

## Before and After

Like in mocha, you can do the following:

```js
export class BarTest {
  before() {}
  beforeEach() {}
  afterEach() {}
  after() {}
}
```

## Assertion API

If you choose to use the FuseBox assertion api, install first:

```bash
npm install fuse-test-runner
```

Assertion API is a chain, you can apply multiple validations for one object. for
example:

```js
should(file.localImports)
  .beMap()
  .mutate(x => x.get("./something"))
  .beMap()
  .mutate(x => x.get("foo"))
  .beInstanceOf(ImportDeclaration)
  .mutate(x => x.name)
  .equal("foo");
```

## Karma

If you prefer to use [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/2.0/index.html) as a
test runner or your project is already using it, you can add FuseBox as a
preprocessor for your test files.
