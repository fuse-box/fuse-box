# Plugin API

Plugin API has a very powerful mechanism of manipulating the output.

Let's take a look a plugin's interface first

```typescript
interface Plugin {
  test?: RegExp;
  opts?: any;
  init?: { (context: WorkFlowContext) };

  transform: { (file: File, ast?: any) };
  transformGroup?(file: File): any;
  onTypescriptTransform?: { (file: File) };

  dependencies?: string[];

  preBundle?(context: WorkFlowContext);
  bundleStart?(context: WorkFlowContext);
  bundleEnd?(context: WorkFlowContext);
  postBundle?(context: WorkFlowContext);

  // available, but not implemented yet
  preBuild?(context: WorkFlowContext);
  postBuild?(context: WorkFlowContext);
}
```

## Spec

### test [RegExp]

Defining `test` will filter files into your plugin. For example `\.js$` If
specified you plugin's `transform` will get triggered upon transformation. It's
optional. Experiment with [regex101](http://regex101.com/) to see it will match.

### dependencies

`dependencies` a list of npm dependencies your plugin might require. If
provided, then the dependencies are loaded on the client before the plugin is
invoked. For example
[this case](https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box/blob/master/src/plugins/stylesheet/CSSplugin.ts#L23)

### init

Happens when a plugin is initialized. It is common practice to reset your plugin
state in this method.

### transform

`transform` if your plugin has a `test` property, fusebox will trigger transform
method sending [file][src-file] as a first argument.

### triggers

#### bundleStart

Happens on bundle start. A good place to inject your custom code here. For
example
[here](https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box/blob/master/src/plugins/HotReloadPlugin.ts#L14)

#### bundleEnd

All files are bundled. But it has not been finalized and written to a file.

#### preBundle

Triggered after adding shims.

#### postBundle

Triggered after the bundle source has been finalized, but before it is written
to file. [UglifyPlugin](#UglifyJSPlugin) uses this trigger.

[see the source code that triggers these plugin methods](https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box/blob/master/src/core/FuseBox.ts#L179)

## Alternative content

If for some reason we want to preserve file contents for a later reuse and
override the output, we can use `file.alternativeContent` which affects directly
bundling process over
[here](https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box/blob/96b646a632f886f296a533ccf4c45f436cf443f3/src/BundleSource.ts#L133)

It can be use for the [concat](#concat-files) technique for example

If an array of plugins is passed, those plugins will be chained

```js
FuseBox.init({
  plugins: [fsbx.JSONPlugin(), [fsbx.LESSPlugin(), fsbx.CSSPlugin()]],
});
```

## Transform

### Helpers

#### File

- `file.contents`: can rewrite the output of a particular chunk, it is a simple
  string
- `file.info`: information about the file, such as `file.info.absPath` and
  `file.info.fuseBoxPath`
- `file.analysis.dependencies`: can clear/flush dependencies of a file by
  setting it to an empty array.
- [read the File source for more](https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box/blob/master/src/analysis/FileAnalysis.ts#L28)

### AST

To use the AST, you need to know if the AST has been loaded already. You can do
this by checking whether `file.analysis.ast` is not `undefined`.

If it has not been loaded, it can be loaded by doing:

```js
file.loadContents();
file.analysis.parseUsingAcorn();
file.analysis.analyze();
```

If the babel plugin has been used, the AST will be loaded using
[babel babylon](https://github.com/babel/babylon).

You can load any ast parser you'd like by

```js
if (!file.analysis.ast) {
  const result = YourAST(file.contents);
  file.analysis.loadAst(result.ast);
  file.analysis.analyze();
}
```

[read the FileAnalysis source for more](https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box/blob/master/src/core/File.ts)

## Transforming typescript

You can transform typescript code before it actually gets to transpiling

```js
const MySuperTranformation = {
  onTypescriptTransform: file => {
    file.contents += "\n console.log('I am here')";
  },
};
FuseBox.init({
  plugins: [MySuperTranformation],
});
```

## Concat files

It is possible to concat files into one using the plugin API. There is
[ConcatPlugin](https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box/blob/master/src/plugins/ConcatPlugin.ts#L51)
which serves as an example for the subject.

In order to understand how it works imagine a plugin chain:

```js
[/\.txt$/, fsbx.ConcatPlugin({ ext: ".txt", name: "textBundle.txt" })],
```

We have 2 files, `a.txt` and `b.txt` which are captured by the plugin API, and
each of them is redirected to the ConcatPlugin's transform, which looks like
this:

```js
public transform(file: File) {
    // Loading the contents of file a.txt or b.txt
    file.loadContents();

    let context = file.context;

    // create a file group in the context with name which is set in the plugin configuration
    // let's say "txtBundle.txt"
    let fileGroup = context.getFileGroup(this.bundleName);
    if (!fileGroup) {
        fileGroup = context.createFileGroup(this.bundleName);
    }
    // Adding current file (say a.txt) as a subFile
    fileGroup.addSubFile(file);

    // making sure the current file refers to an object at runtime that calls our bundle
    file.alternativeContent = `module.exports = require("./${this.bundleName}")`;
}
```

When we register a new file group `context.createFileGroup("txtBundle.txt")`
FuseBox creates a **fake** or a virtual file which is added to the dependency
tree. This file has a special mode, called `groupMode`.

We need to alter the output as well using [alternative content](#Alternative
content). Original contents will be ignored by the Source bundler.

After FuseBox has bundled all files related to your current project, it checks
for groups over
[here](https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box/blob/master/src/ModuleCollection.ts#L260),
iterates and executes plugins. Then each plugin is tested accordingly (now our
file name is called `txtBundle.txt` with `.txt` extension) and executes
`transformGroup` of a plugin if set.

You should understand that `txtBundle.txt` behaves like any other file, with one
exception - it does not call `transform` but `tranformGroup` instead.

```js
public transformGroup(group: File) {
    let contents = [];
    group.subFiles.forEach(file => {
        contents.push(file.contents);
    });
    let text = contents.join(this.delimiter);
    group.contents = `module.exports = ${JSON.stringify(text)}`;
}
```

Now our bundle has a virtual file which looks like this:

```js
___scope___.file("textBundle.txt", function(
  exports,
  require,
  module,
  __filename,
  __dirname,
) {
  module.exports = "hello\nworld";
});
```

### Things to experiment with

- try changing the contents of a file
- try logging the contents of the file in the transformation file
- try logging the ast once it has been loading
