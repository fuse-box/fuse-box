# Tips

Below are some tips that will improve your experience and help you avoiding
gotchas while using **FuseBox**.

## General tips

- Don't import **FuseBox** in your code, it will cause issues, it is already
  added to your bundle and available globally and you can access it anywhere in
  your code like when you access `window` on client or `global` in `Node.js`.
  for example to import a file just use `FuseBox.import('./myfile')`
- Use the [EnvPlugin](#envplugin) to pass Environmental variables on both client
  and server, you can even use packages like
  [safe-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/safe-env) with it.
- **FuseBox** `API` has neat `isServer` and `isBrowser` methods, use them to
  check the environment the code is running in. for example `FuseBox.isServer`
  will return `true` if you are running your code in `Node.js`

## TypeScript tips

- You don't have to worry about `module` option in **TypeScript** compiler
  options, Fuse will automatically set it up for you, even if you forget to add
  it.

## Electron tips

[Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) has 2 JavaScript environments. One is Node
JS (called main) and one is Chromium (called renderer).

Electron gives the renderer process the ability to call native commands by
proxying through the `electron` module.

To make this setup work with **FuseBox**, you'll need to **add** these two
options to the bundle targeting your renderer.

```js
{
  serverBundle: true,
  shim: {
    electron: { exports: "global.require('electron')" },
  },
}
```

The `serverBundle` command tells **FuseBox** to make available some of the Node
JS modules (`path`, `fs`, etc.) to that JS environment.

The `shim` acts as a pass through instructing **FuseBox** to trust us that
`electron` is available to require. The `global.` is important since **FuseBox**
as already called dibs on `require()`. They left us `global.require()` for these
types of shenanigans. :beers:

No need to include or exclude `+electron` from your bundles. Just these few
lines will do the job.

Happy Electron-ing!
