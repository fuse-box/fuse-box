# Contributing

First of all, thanks for chosing FuseBox. Our mission is to deliver the best developer experience for javascript developers. But we need your help. Any contribution is absolutely valuable, starting from just giving ideas and drafting a PR.

But before you fork and actually starting coding something let's define some rules.

## Guide

### Communication first

The easiest way to start is by creating an issue. If you have something that requires live chatting join our Gitter channel and poke @nchanged. Certainly, if you PR consists of just fixing typos, there is no need in issue.

Having an issue will give the community full transparency on what's happening and who is doing what. Therefore - communication first.

### Mind the formatting

It's easier to review if your changes are readable. Please, respect the formatting and if you see that your editor changes the entire file, please revert and disable auto formatting. 

## No breaking changes

Do not attempt to make breaking changes unless it has been discussed. There is an exception where it's possible to toggle the functionality behind an option, anyway, see [Communication first](#communication-first)


### Developing

Seetting up development is very easy - `gulp dev` will prepare everything including `_playground/generic` folder. So you can start helping out and testing bugfixes and features right away.

```bash
gulp dev
``` 

Wait a little a bit until all modules are copied and FuseBox has launched itself to bundle FuseBox. Yes, we are using FuseBox to bundle FuseBox for development. That's insanely fast. Hit save and your dev bundle is ready in 50ms. (We are using one of the stable versions of FuseBox located in `bin` folder - that version is isolated from everything else)

```bash
cd _playground/generic
node fuse
```

Feel free to create as many folders as required, This folder is in `.gitignore`

### How to test

Run

```bash
gulp installDevDeps
```

That will install a bunch of super heavy libraries, that's why they are not added to `dev-deps`. Mind `package.json` Your npm shouldn't save them there, if it did - please revert `package.json`

Run all tests
```bash
node test
```

Run one test case
```bash
node test --file=CSSDependencyExtractor.test.ts
```
