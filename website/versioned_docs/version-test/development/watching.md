FuseBox can automatically re-bundle your bundles on file change. FuseBox
Producer makes sure that only 1 watcher is bound (chokidar).

```js
const app = fuse
  .bundle("app")
  .instructions(`> app.tsx`)
  .watch();
```

`watch()` accepts a simplified regex (if you want to customise watched folder).
Let's watch server and client bundle at the same time.

```js
fuse
  .bundle("client/app")
  .instructions(`> app.tsx`)
  .watch("client/**");

fuse
  .bundle("server/app")
  .instructions(`> index.ts`)
  .watch("server/**");
```

In this example whenever a change happen in `homeDir` FuseBox will figure out
which bundle requires re-triggering. It's implemented in order to save up your
resources as physically only 1 watcher is defined.

A typical configuration for production builds would look like:

```js
if (!production) {
  app.hmr().watch();
}
```

### Chokidar options

Additionally, you can provide [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar)
options to `run()`

```js
fuse.run({ chokidar: { ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../ } });
```

### Problems with some cloud providers

To solve some issues with running on docker container providers set this:

```ts
fuse.run({ chokidar: { awaitWriteFinish: true } });
```
