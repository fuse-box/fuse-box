## Description

Copies your files to a destination folder and return a hashed URL when required
in your code. If no options are specified, the plugin copies your files into
`assets` folder

## Usage

### Setup

Import from FuseBox

```js
const { CopyPlugin } = require("fuse-box");
```

Inject into a chain

```js
fuse.plugin(CopyPlugin({ files: ["*.txt"] }));
```

Or add it to the main config plugins list to make it available across bundles

```js
FuseBox.init({
  plugins: [CopyPlugin({ files: ["*.txt"] })],
});
```

### Require file in your code

With `useDefault : false`

```js
import * as foo from "./foo.txt";
```

With `useDefault : true`

```js
import foo from "./foo.txt";
```

## Options

## useDefault

`useDefault` is enabled by default. So a transpiled code would look like:

```js
module.exports.default = "/assets/43e9685c-foo.txt";
```

You can override it and drop back to `module.exports` by switching to
`useDefault : false`

```js
CopyPlugin({ useDefault: false, files: [".txt", ".png"] });
```

Will result in:

```js
module.exports = "/assets/43e9685c-foo.txt";
```

## files

CopyPlugin accepts `files` which should be an array. All expressions must be
`simplified Regexp` strings. You can set an extension to make it globally
available, or define a specific path if you wish to handle files only in one
particular folder.

Global:

```js
CopyPlugin({ files: [".txt", ".png"] });
```

Partial

```js
CopyPlugin({ files: ["static/*.txt", "static/some/**.png"] });
```

## dest

Customise server path by providing `dest` option. Note, that your global
`output` configuration is considered to be the root. Don't set an absolute path
as it will break the overall consistency (global settings for hashing for
example).

Global:

```js
CopyPlugin({ files: [".txt", ".png"], dest: "static" });
```

CopyPlugin will still resolve it as `assets/foo.txt` if no `resolve` options is
set.

## resolve

You can customise path resolving in the browser.

```js
CopyPlugin({
  files: [".txt", ".png"],
  dest: "static",
  resolve: "static/files",
});
```

If you copy `foo.txt` it will result in `/static/92849cf0-hello.txt`, however
you will receive `/static/files/92849cf0-hello.txt`

## Test

To run tests

```
node test --file=CopyPlugin.test.ts
```
